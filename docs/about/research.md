# Research Interests

My primary research focus is **Perturbative QCD** and **Standard Model Phenomenology**. I am particularly interested in all-order resummation techniques for event shape observables at electron-positron colliders and the LHC.

**Topic:** *Precision QCD and Higher-Order Resummation*
<br> **Supervisor:** Prof. Giancarlo Ferrera

I am currently a Master's Candidate (*Laureando Magistrale*) continuing the investigation into high-precision QCD predictions. My work focuses on:

* **Higher-Order Resummation:** Extending the analytical resummation accuracy (towards **N³LL** and beyond) for event shapes.
* **Phenomenological Applications:** Analyzing the impact of these higher-order corrections on the precise extraction of the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s$, from collider data.

### **Resummation in the Thrust Distribution**

For my Bachelor's thesis, I studied the resummed cross-section for the **Thrust ($T$)** variable in $e^+e^-$ annihilation processes.



!!! info "Definition: Thrust"
    Thrust is a classic event shape variable used to characterize the geometry of an event. It is defined as:
    
    $$
    \tau = 1-T = 1- \max_{\vec{n}} \frac{\sum_i |\vec{p}_i \cdot \vec{n}|}{\sum_i |\vec{p}_i|}
    $$
    
    In the limit $\tau \to 0$ (the **two-jet limit**), large logarithms of the form $L = \ln(1/\tau)$ appear at every order in perturbation theory, spoiling the convergence of the fixed-order expansion.

**Methodology:**
I reproduced and extended the seminal calculations by **Catani, Trentadue, Turnock, and Webber (CTTW)**, who established the standard formalism for exponentiating these large logarithms in the Soft and Collinear limits.

**Key Achievements:**

* **Phase Space Analysis:** Implemented **Genetic Algorithms** (Heuristic optimization) to numerically determine the kinematic lower bounds of Thrust as a function of final-state parton multiplicity.
* **Precision Calculation:** Extended the resummed integrated cross-section $\Sigma(\tau)$ in the two-jet limit, achieving **N³LL accuracy** (Next-to-Next-to-Next-to-Leading Logarithmic).
