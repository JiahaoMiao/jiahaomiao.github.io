## **About Me**

I am a Theoretical Physics student based in **Milan, Italy**.

My research focuses on **Perturbative QCD**, specifically the study of event shape variables like **Thrust** ($\tau$). I am currently working on extending resummation accuracy to higher orders under the supervision of Prof. Giancarlo Ferrera.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Physics from the University of Milan in July 2024.
